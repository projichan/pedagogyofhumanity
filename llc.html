      <p>
        Pedagogy of Humanity, LLC provides research-informed consultation and advocacy specializing in trauma-responsive education across the ecosystem — 
        equipping families with tools and advocacy to strengthen home–school connections, 
        supporting PreK–12 educators to reframe their practice through a trauma-responsive lens, and helping teacher-prep programs embed trauma-responsive design into their curriculum.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teachers aren’t burning out because they don’t care — they’re burning out because no one taught them how to respond to trauma. 
        There are currently no undergraduate teacher-prep programs that systematically incorporate trauma-responsive learning. 
        This leaves new teachers stepping into classrooms without the tools to recognize or respond to trauma-behaviors.
      </p>

      <p>
        In PreK–12 schools, the result is classrooms that feel unsafe, overwhelmed educators, and burnout that drives teachers out of the profession. 
        Families, too, often find themselves without the strategies or support to navigate behavioral challenges at home — further straining the home–school connection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both universities and school systems urgently need ways to bridge this gap, and families need accessible tools to build resilience at home. 
        Without these supports, teachers and caregivers remain underprepared, students lose stability, and communities bear the costs of burnout and lost potential.

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p><strong>Teachers and families are burning out not from lack of care, but from lack of trauma-responsive tools.</strong></p>
        <p>
          This work advances trauma-responsive education that sustains families, teachers, and institutions — not just classrooms.
          Brittany brings trauma-responsive practice into teacher-prep programs, PreK–12 schools, and families.
          For universities, she <strong>consults</strong> on curriculum design, embedding trauma-informed frameworks into undergraduate programs so new teachers graduate ready for the realities of trauma-behaviors.
          For schools, she <strong>provides</strong> training and consultation that helps educators reframe their practice through a trauma-responsive lens.
          For families, she <strong>offers</strong> tools, advocacy, and holistic support to strengthen home–school connections and reduce stress at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her approach emphasizes resilience, empathy, compassion, and self-care — because preparing teachers and supporting families isn’t just about managing trauma-behaviors; it’s about equipping people to stay grounded and whole in the process. By centering these values, her work creates safer classrooms, reduces burnout, strengthens families, and sustains institutions for the long term.

        <h2>Why Pedagogy of Humanity, LLC is Different</h2>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;">
          Most programs focus on only one part of the education system — families, schools, or universities.
          The Pedagogy of Humanity is unique in bridging all three. By working simultaneously with families, PreK–12 educators, and higher education, this approach strengthens the entire ecosystem of learning. This whole-community focus ensures that resilience is built not in isolation, but through connected systems that reinforce one another.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
          The Pedagogy of Humanity connects home, classroom, and campus — building resilience across the entire learning ecosystem.
