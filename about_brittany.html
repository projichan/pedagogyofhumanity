        <p>
          Brittany L. Stratton is the founder and steward of the <em>Pedagogy of Humanity</em> — a movement born from both lived experience and scholarship. She is a doctoral student, teacher, mother, daughter, and sister. Most importantly, she is a human being who has faced and survived trauma, and who now turns that survival into purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brittany’s childhood was marked by abuse, family violence, and the failures of the systems meant to protect her. By the age of eleven, she had experienced both foster care and the painful reality of being returned to unsafe environments. At seventeen, as a pregnant teenager, she left home and began forging a new path — one rooted in the search for safety and love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through these experiences, Brittany came to believe that <strong>safety is the highest form of love</strong>. This conviction, alongside her resilience and compassion, became the foundation of her life’s work. She has spent more than fifteen years nurturing her own healing while helping others find pathways to theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Brittany is building the Pedagogy of Humanity as both a philosophy and a practical framework. It begins with the recognition of each person’s humanity and insists that safety and dignity are not luxuries, but rights of birth. Through her writing, research, and teaching, she creates spaces where scars are not hidden but honored, and where education becomes an act of love.

        <h2>Guiding Beliefs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Safety is the highest form of love.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>No act of kindness done in love is ever wasted.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>In all things, teach.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:12px">
          These principles inform how we design classrooms, policies, relationships, and communities. They are simple
          on purpose — and radically demanding in practice.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Grounding Frameworks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory</li>
          <li>Maslow’s hierarchy reframed through safety and dignity</li>
          <li>Holistic Wheel of Wellness</li>
          <li>Trauma-responsive, relationship-centered practice</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:12px">
          The Pedagogy of Humanity synthesizes these traditions into a coherent, humane approach to teaching and learning.

    <section class="section card">
      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop and articulate the Pedagogy of Humanity as a living, practical framework.</li>
        <li>Write and speak about trauma-responsive education and human-centered design.</li>
        <li>Create tools and resources (e.g., guided journals, children’s books, practical guides) aligned to the pedagogy.</li>
        <li>Collaborate with educators, organizations, and communities to translate values into daily practice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why This Site Is Independent</h2>
      <p>
        This site is an independent home for the Pedagogy of Humanity — separate from any institution — so its voice,
        integrity, and evolution remain with its community of practice.
